        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Shashank Shekhar, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently pursuing my B.Tech from Techno Main Salt Lake under Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, I'm deeply interested in the world of AI, data science, and software development.</p>
    
        <p>I've had the opportunity to explore various domains through academic projects and a virtual internship with Google, where I honed my skills in machine learning and data analysis. I'm also actively learning web development, both frontend and backend, to broaden my skill set.</p>
    
        <p>My goal is to leverage technology to solve real-world problems, and I'm particularly excited about the potential of AI in making an impact across different industries. I'm currently looking to gain more experience through internships and collaborative projects.</p>
    
        <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy working on personal projects, participating in hackathons, and staying updated with the latest tech trends. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!</p>
